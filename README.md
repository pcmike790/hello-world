# hello-world
The Hello World project is not what you think. This project involves the clearing of a loft and the conversion into a work office/ storage room.
This is not really a group project, but more of a personal one.
The upcoming projects will call on the experinces of users with similiar projects that can offer alternative solutions, or the best practice to achieve the desired results.
