# hello-world
The Hello World project is not what you think. This project involves the clearing of a loft and the conversion into a work office/ storage room.
This is not really a group project, but more of a personal one.
The upcoming projects I have in the pipeline will call on the experinces of users with similiar projects that can offer alternative solutions, or the best practice to achieve the desired results.
I require help to create a bookeeping app that can link stock control in it's process.
This will wnable me to order, sell and keep track of payments in, out and overdue.
